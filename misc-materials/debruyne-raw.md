Most of the modules of my course are to be found here: https://chrdebru.github.io/courses/ois/. A stripped-down version of these exists to train research engineers.

The narrative of these modules are as follows:

Part 1: Intro

Lecture 1: Introduction to Ontology and OIS
In short, the definition of an ontology and its role in semantic interoperability. The Semantic Web is then introduced as an application of ontologies.

Part 2: Knowledge Representation on the Web
Lecture 2: RDF and RDF(S)
Lecture 3: Description Logics
Lecture 4: Web Ontology Language

Part 3: Consuming and Using RDF
Lecture 5: Querying with SPARQL
Lecture 6: Linked Data
Lecture 9: Ontology Matching

Part 4: Creating RDF
Lecture 7: Generating RDF with R2RML
Lecture 8: Evaluating and Validating Ontologies and Knowledge Bases
Lecture 10: Dataset Metadata and Provenance Information

The course, called Open Information Systems, used to be built upon a course on conceptual modeling for information systems (called Information Systems). The conceptual modeling techniques taught in that course were adopted for the ontology engineering exercises in Open Information Systems. In short, Object Role Modelling (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-role_modeling) and a subset of SBVR (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_of_Business_Vocabulary_and_Business_Rules) were used to model the UoD, and then "implemented" using SemWeb ontology languages. The two sessions on conceptual modeling for open information systems used to precede Part 2 in the outline above.
